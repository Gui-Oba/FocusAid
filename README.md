## FocusAid

A Chrome extension to help me focus. Does two simple things:
- Simplifies Instagram to the essentials. Only see posts from accounts you follow. Removes the explore and reels pages.
- Block list function restricts access to specified sites

## How to use
- In allowlist.txt, add usernames you would like to see posts from, each on a newline
- In blocklist.txt, add domains of websites you no longer like access to
